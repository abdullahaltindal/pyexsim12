# pyexsim12
## Python package for running EXSIM12 finite-fault stochastic ground motion simulation code


## About
pyexsim12 is a Python package for:
* Creating input files for EXSIM12
* Running simulations
* Post-processing simulation results
* Visualizing inputs, simulated accelerograms and other relevant post-processing products, such as Fourier or response spectra
* Comparing simulations to empirical ground motion models
* Calculating misfits between simulated and recorded ground motions, if recorded motions are available

Most of the functionality is illustrated in example files, and no additional documentation is currently available.
