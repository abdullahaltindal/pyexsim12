* Add (optional) to opt. parameters in docs
* Type annotation.
* Misfit in FAS does not work because the frequency values are different for simulated and recorded motions, because of different lengths. This can be solved with
interpolation functions of scipy. Or, I can use the length of the simulated accelerogram while calculating the fas for the recorded motion.
