  EXSIM12 input for M6.5 130bars: 2 sites at Rjb 10, 50km
!Write acc, psa, husid files for each site?

!fault type (S=strikeslip; R=reverse; N=normal; U=undifferentiated)
! (Only used if Wells and Coppersmith is used to obtain FL and FW).
  S
!fault length and width, dl, dw, stress_ref
!Note: Force program to use Wells and Coppersmith (WC) for FL and/or FW if
! either entry = 0.0.
! dl and dw are the subsource length and width
! stress_ref is a reference to allow scaling of WC size as per Atkinson&Boore(2006BSSA)
! If Wells and Coppersmith are used to obtain FL and/or FW, the WC values are
! modified to account for the scaling implied by differences in the stress
! specified above and a stress that is assumed to be valid for the generic WC
! relations; this stress is stress_ref. The value of 70 bars is an educated
! guess for stress_ref, but it is not based on a quantitative analysis.
! The WC values of FL and/or FW are multiplied by the factor
! (stress_ref/stress)^(1/3).
! Note that four entries on the following line are needed as placeholders,
! even if not used)
